# Actors and Movies Many-to-Many Relationship using Python and SQLAlchemy
  This CLI mini app demonstrates how to create a many-to-many relationship between actors and movies using Python and SQLAlchemy 1.4.41. We'll build a simple database structure where actors can be associated with multiple movies, and movies can have multiple actors.
# Environment set-up:
        1. Create virtual environment.
        2. install required packages.
            1. install sqlalchemy package for mapping python classes to tables using sqlite dialect.
            2. install alembic package for generating migration.
            3. install ipdp package for debugging.
            4. faker package for generating fake data.
        3. generate migration.
        4. import declarative base from sqlalchemy.
        5. create DB schema.
        6. populate the DB.
        7. test the relationships (many to many)

# Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of a many-to-many relationship between actors and movies using Python and SQLAlchemy. You can extend and customize this project to suit more complex requirements, such as adding additional fields to the tables or implementing advanced querying.
